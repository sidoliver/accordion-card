## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
 * I learned how to use two different images for mobile and desktop version.
 * How to make responsive website using media query.
 * Using flexbox for seamless design.
 * Hide a pertion of an Image beind a div.
 * How to toggle a class using javascript.
 * Javascript forEach loop.
 ### This was a very challenging project indeed. I struggled to  position the images in a certain order. It took me 26 hours to build this project but It is still half cooked. There are some major issues in my design pattern. I am reading blogs to findout the best possible way to solve my problems more efficiently. Those are: 
  * selecting the best font size suffix(px, rem, em , vh, %)
  * effective use of display properties.
  * clear idea of margin and padding
  * z-index and content stacking.


### Continued development
 I think I am not fully confident about responsive design pattern. I am doing the projects just by hit and trial method. I have to make a process to build the projects. I will learn the best design practices and in my future projects I will try to implement them. 
### Useful resources

- [responsive image design](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-images/) - This helped me to use images for various screen sizes and display types.
